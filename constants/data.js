      desc: "During my time as the RIS, I was able to demonstrate unwavering commitment to empowering veterans by conducting extensive research and outreach effort focused on VA program and services.  The primary focus was to gain valuable insight on resources offered to the community to begin to pave the way for the digitization of services, ultimately enhancing resource accessibility for veterans. Through thorough research, I identified specific programs and resources that could be digitized, resulting in a comprehensive list of 23 opportunities for outreach. To quantify the potential impact of digitization, I estimated the significant time savings (up to 95%) and the improved ease of access for veterans in obtaining essential resources. To initiate the digitization efforts, I created a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlining 30 specific requirements, serving as the foundation for this transformative endeavor. Throughout the process, I maintained meticulous records of the outreach activities and the information collected, resulting in a valuable repository of data for future reference. By conducting thorough analysis and evaluation of the collected information, I gained a deep understanding of the community's needs and perspectives, further guiding the efforts towards serving our veterans",
