    info: ["We developed a Digital Wallet to facilitate economic opportunities for individuals in the community. This project involved numerous discussions on how to execute it effectively, ultimately leading us to create a Mobile Application for Android users, with plans to expand to iOS in the future. Our main objective was to ensure the app was easily accessible, simple to download, and featured a clear and straightforward front-end design to minimize confusion.",
      "I took on the roles of lead UI/UX Designer and Product Manager, which provided me with valuable real-world experience in building a Near Field Communication App (NFC) in collaboration with different stakeholders and team members. Our team consisted of three individuals, and we directly worked with one stakeholder. However, we also received assistance from other individuals who supported us throughout the project.",
      "To develop the app, we utilized various technologies, including the Azure Database, Figma, and Android Studio (Java). Additionally, we conducted extensive external research to enhance the functionality of the application. Through these efforts, we were able to meet the stakeholders' requirements and bring the app up to the desired standard. ",
      "Throughout the project's duration, I achieved my SAFe 5 certification and recently upgraded it to SAFe 6. We also underwent the Microsoft Azure free training online, which significantly improved our understanding of the project and its technical aspects.",
      "Overall, this project allowed me to gain practical experience in developing an NFC-based Digital Wallet. Working closely with stakeholders, utilizing various technologies, and enhancing my certifications and knowledge base were key highlights of this endeavor.",

    info: ["During a school project, we embarked on a class assignment that provided an invaluable opportunity to apply my skills as a Product Manager in a real-world context. With a clear objective in mind, I set out to create a practical application, and I chose to collaborate with Alpha Chi Omega, my sorority, leveraging my deep understanding of the organization and identifying areas where technology could make a significant impact.",
      "To ensure a robust foundation, we meticulously documented our progress, crafting formal Business Requirement Specifications (BRS) and System Requirement Specifications (SRS) tailored specifically for our esteemed sponsor. By closely engaging with stakeholders, our aim was to develop an intuitive, efficient, and visually captivating app that would address the existing application's limitations. To approach writing, interviews, and requirements gathering comprehensively and efficiently, I skillfully incorporated the Elder Paul Model and other pertinent resources.While coding wasn't the focus of this project, I presented Alpha Chi Omega with a wireframe illustrating a potential user experience (UX) design that could be implemented during the production phase. My primary focus was on delivering top-notch outputs, relying heavily on critical thinking throughout the entire process.",
      "The project provided an ideal platform to exercise my product management skills, fostering productive stakeholder collaboration, and culminating in a tangible solution that could positively transform the organization's operations.",

    info: ["I thoroughly enjoyed working on a music Discord bot for our project. It was a challenging task that greatly enhanced my backend skills as I had to establish connections between the Discord app and my code. The bot's functionality included features such as play, pause, skip, loop, back, and queue, making it a comprehensive music playback solution. ",
      "This project was not only enjoyable but also a valuable learning experience. It provided me with hands-on practice in developing and integrating a bot within the Discord platform. I look forward to undertaking similar projects in the future and continuing to expand my knowledge and skills in this area.",

    info: ["Our mission was to utilize Image Processing techniques to understand Mars' layout and identify hazards for the rover's safety. With over 100,000 NASA-provided images, we developed a Machine Learning algorithm to analyze and detect hazards accurately. Most algorithms improved the model, but one decreased accuracy due to noise. Training the AI took around 4 hours with that algorithm, compared to 20-30 minutes without it.",
      "Our algorithm employed various techniques, including preprocessing, edge detection (Canny, Gaussian, Laplacian), morphological operations, and local binary patterns. Despite limitations in achieving 100% accuracy, we achieved significant progress by leveraging a large sample size, iterating the data, and using oversampling techniques.",
